A computer vision model that detects work card fraud. This project will help different companies in detecting whether the Card provided to them by their employees or customers is original or not. An organization can use this model for any type of card like insurance cards, Voter cards, personal id or bank id. We calculate structural similarity of the original card and the card shown by the user.
